# Categories for the Working Mathematician in Coq

I'm trying to learn Coq and figured maybe trying to translate some proofs from *Categories for the Working Mathematician* by Saunders Mac Lane might be a good exercise,

Don't know if I'll ever get around to it, contributions would always be welcome though.
